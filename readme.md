# tomm CLI

This repository houses a CLI tool I intend to use for personal use. The commands are useful things I need at a moment's notice when writing code.

## Usage

In the project directory run

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

this will install `tomm_cli` into `/home/{{username}}/.cargo/bin`. Ensure this path is in your `$PATH` to execute the command line tool.
